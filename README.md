# Machine Learning Supervised Learning: Car Price Prediction Model

- Proposed Domain: Building a model to predict car pricing, based on selling price, car type, year, miles driven, and more. 
- Hypothesis: Utilizing the Supervised Learning regression models, we can accurately predict a carâ€™s price based on its characteristics.
- ML that matters: The data can be used on Car Lots to predict used car prices. 
- Dataset: Vehicle Data set on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho
- Total Size: 299 kB
- Number of Examples: 14,830
- Dimension of Instances (n): name, year, selling price, km driven, fuel, seller type, transmission, Owner
- Proposed Contributions: Ameer (5033) will implement Linear Regression and K-N-N., Namil (4033) will implement Decision Trees and Random Forest.


## K-Nearest-Neighbors

- Logic: given our dataset, we break it down into training examples (instances). From there, we have the relevant data for the specific training examples and we would predict the label (output) based on our car data. In our case, the output label is the car price, while the input is car data from the dataset.
- We can add weights and learning rates to test other options.
- May need to split into validation sets (?).
- Use HW-4 for pseduo-code implementation.
