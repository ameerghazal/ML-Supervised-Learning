# Machine Learning Supervised Learning: Car Price Prediction Model

- Proposed Domain: Building a model to predict car pricing, based on selling price, car type, year, miles driven, and more. 
- Hypothesis: Utilizing the Supervised Learning regression models, we can accurately predict a carâ€™s price based on its characteristics.
- ML that matters: The data can be used on Car Lots to predict used car prices. 
- Dataset: Vehicle Data set on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho
- Total Size: 299 kB
- Number of Examples: 14,830
- Dimension of Instances (n): name, year, selling price, km driven, fuel, seller type, transmission, Owner
- Proposed Contributions: Ameer (5033) will implement Linear Regression and K-N-N., Namil (4033) will implement Decision Trees and Random Forest.
